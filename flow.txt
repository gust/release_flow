What state are we in?
- if we are in the middle of a release there will be a release branch and release candidate tag(s) 
  without a corresponding release tag where the version represents the latest release or candidate

Example (this does NOT mean we're in the middle of a release, it means we've abandoned one):
1.2.1-rc1
1.2.1-rc2
1.2.1-rc3
1.2.1

1.1.0-rc1


Moving through the states:

is there a bugs branch of the form release/<latest_release_candidate/bugs/* (we are in process of fixing a bug on a release candidate) ?
  yes -> goto Step 3
  no -> 
    can we find a RC newer than last release ?
      no -> (done)
        create a new release candidate
        push tags
      yes -> 
        is the RC good?
          yes -> (done) goto Step 2
          no -> 
            remove all RC tags for the corresponding upcoming release (e.g. 1.2.1-rc1, 1.2.1-rc2, etc), 
            push tags
            goto Step 1



Hotfix -> a branch of the form "release/<latest_release>/hotfix/*" exists


State: No release in progress
  - asks whether release or hotfix

  Release:
    - takes the latest green ci tag
    - Tag Release Candidate
      - tags the head of this branch as release candidate
      - push tags
      - let's you know what it did
      - exit

  Hotfix:
    - git co release/1.1.0
    - create a hotfix branch: git co -b release/<latest_release>/hotfix/descriptive-name
    - let's you know what it did
    - exit

State: Hotfix is in progress
  - asks whether hotfix is complete

  Yes:
    - Tag Release Candidate
      - tags the head of this branch as release candidate -> increment Patch - rc1
      - push tags
      - delete hotfix branch
      - let's you know what it did
      - exit

  No:
    - checkout hotfix branch

State: Release in progress
  State: Release Bugfix in progress
    - asks whether bug is fixed

    Yes:
      - merge bug fix branch into temporary branch --no-ff
      - merge bug fix branch into integration --no-ff
      - delete bug fix branch
      - delete bug fix branch on origin
      - tag new release candidate
      - delete temporary branch

    No:
      - checkout bugfix branch

  State: No Bugfix in progress
    - asks whether release candidate is good

    Yes:
      - checkout release candidate tag
      - tag release
      - push tags

      ********** Hotfix Related ***************
      - Is release a hotfix? (patch level increment from last release)
        - merge hotfix into integration --no--ff
        - push integration

      - let's you know what it did
      - tells you to deploy

    No:
      - branch off of the latest release candidate tag to create temporary branch
      - prompt for <bug_name>
      - branch off the temporary branch to create a bug fix branch: release/1.2.1-rc1/bugs/<bug_name>
      - tell user to fix the bug
      - exit
